Feature: Order History (OHF_005)
  Users can view past orders from their account dashboard (missing feature).

  @Functional
  Scenario: OHF_005_001 (Past Orders History)
    Given I am logged in
    When I go to "My Account" or "Order History"
    Then I should not find any real order history page
    And see an error/placeholder if not implemented


  @Exploratory
  Scenario: OHF_005_002 (Loading history for large orders)
    Given I have many past orders if the feature existed
    When I try to load them
    Then the site cannot display them since order history is missing
    And performance cannot be tested

  @Functional
  Scenario: OHF_005_003 (Order details accuracy)
    Given I want to verify my past order details
    When I open a hypothetical order detail page
    Then I realize no actual order detail is shown
    And the site shows a 404 page
